# Excel_Analysis_Projects - Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
   - Louise, a client, recently conducted a fundraiser for her play "Fever". She raised most of her goal in a short amount of time and wanted to see how other campains did in comparison to her in terms of time and goal attainment. We will show the outcomes based on launch date and the outcomes based on fundrasing goals to show if Louise's efforts were successful in terms of the overal landscape. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  - Throughout the years we see that Theater funraisers have the most success if they start in May. May fundraisers saw 111 successes, 52 fails, and 3 cancellations for a total of 166 fundraisers. Which gives May a success rate of 68.5%. The next closest would be June with 100 successes out of 153 which would yeild a success rate of 65.3%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  - We see that fundraising goals under $1000 are extremely successful with a success rate of 76%. However, goals between $1000 and $4999 are almost as successful with a success rate of 73% with a majority of the projects falling into these two categories. Additionally, fundraisers with goals between $35,000 - and 39,999 and between $40,000 - 44,999 were almost as successful. Both with a sucess rate of 67% with a significantly smaller sample size.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  - We often see that 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - We can conclude that the most opportunistic time for theater projects to begin fundraising is in MAY. With the summer being the best season to fundraise (June, July, and August)
    - 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   - We can conclude that the Goal that yields the most success would be 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
